# carProject

Small project in attempt to create remotely controlled car using Raspberry Pi Model B, Android device and Bluetooth 3.0 dongle.

Attempt to use Python failed due to performance issues. Basically Python doesn't allow us to control the Camera module buffer directly, so we can't continiously send video data to Android device.
